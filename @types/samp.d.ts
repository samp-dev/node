  Known Bugs:
  Pickups that have a X or Y lower than -4096.0 or bigger than 4096.0 won&#x27;t show up and won&#x27;t trigger OnPlayerPickUpPickup either.

   * @remarks 
  The only type of pickup that can be picked up from inside a vehicle is 14 (except for special pickups such as bribes).
  Pickups are shown to, and can be picked up by all players.
  It is possible that if DestroyPickup is used when a pickup is picked up, more than one player can pick up the pickup, due to lag. This can be circumvented through the use of variables.
  Certain pickup types come with &#x27;automatic responses&#x27;, for example using an M4 model in the pickup will automatically give the player the weapon and some ammo. For fully scripted pickups, type 1 should be used. 

   * @remarks 
  Available Pickup Types
  Most other IDs are either undocumented or are similar to type 1 (but do not use them just because they seem similar to ID 1, they might have side-effects like ID 18 and 20).
  
    0 - The pickup does not always display. If displayed, it can&#x27;t be picked up and does not trigger OnPlayerPickUpPickup and it will stay after server shutdown.
    1 - Exists always. Disables pickup scripts such as horseshoes and oysters to allow for scripted actions ONLY. Will trigger OnPlayerPickUpPickup every few seconds.
    2 - Disappears after pickup, respawns after 30 seconds if the player is at a distance of at least 15 meters.
    3 - Disappears after pickup, respawns after death.
    4 - Disappears after 15 to 20 seconds. Respawns after death.
    8 - Disappears after pickup, but has no effect.
    11 - Blows up a few seconds after being created (bombs?)
    12 - Blows up a few seconds after being created.
    13 - Invisible. Triggers checkpoint sound when picked up with a vehicle, but doesn&#x27;t trigger OnPlayerPickUpPickup.
    14 - Disappears after pickup, can only be picked up with a vehicle. Triggers checkpoint sound.
    15 - Same as type 2.
    18 - Similar to type 1. Pressing Tab (KEY_ACTION) makes it disappear but the key press doesn&#x27;t trigger OnPlayerPickUpPickup.
    19 - Disappears after pickup, but doesn&#x27;t respawn. Makes &quot;cash pickup&quot; sound if picked up.
    20 - Similar to type 1. Disappears when you take a picture of it with the Camera weapon, which triggers &quot;Snapshot # out of 0&quot; message. Taking a picture doesn&#x27;t trigger OnPlayerPickUpPickup.
    22 - Same as type 3.

  Objects that emit light (lampposts, police lights, bollard lights, neons etc.) that have a greater rotation than 16.26 degrees (or -16.26) on either the X or Y axis will stop shining. This effect also applies to light objects attached to other objects, players and vehicles.
  If a light object is attached to a car and the car is rotated over 16.26 degrees (like in a rollover), the object will also stop emitting light. This is a GTA:SA issue and is not caused by a bug in SA-MP.

   * @remarks In case the light is attached to another object, one fix for this is to set SyncRotation to false in AttachObjectToObject. This will ensure the light stays at 0 rotation. This would only really work for objects that consist ONLY of light, so wouldn&#x27;t work for the police light for example.

  The higher drunkenness levels affect the player&#x27;s camera, and the car driving handling. The level of drunkenness increases when the player drinks from a bottle (You can use SetPlayerSpecialAction to give them bottles).

  Players&#x27; drunk level will automatically decrease over time, based on their FPS (players with 50 FPS will lose 50 &#x27;levels&#x27; per second. This is useful for determining a player&#x27;s FPS!).

  The x and y have different meanings with different PlayerTextDrawAlignment values:
  
    1 (left): they are the right-most corner of the box, absolute coordinates.
    2 (center): they need to inverted (switch the two) and the x value is the overall width of the box.
    3 (right): the x and y are the coordinates of the left-most corner of the box 
  

   * @remarks 
  Using font type 4 (sprite) and 5 (model preview) converts X and Y of this function from corner coordinates to WIDTH and HEIGHT (offsets).
  The TextDraw box starts 10.0 units up and 5.0 to the left as the origin (TextDrawCreate coordinate).
  This function defines the clickable area for use with PlayerTextDrawSetSelectable, whether a box is shown or not.

   * @remarks You can use color embedding on the number plate text.
   * @remarks 
  This function has no internal error checking. Do not assign custom number plates to vehicles without plates (boats, planes, etc) as this will result in some unneeded processing time on the client.
  The vehicle must be re-spawned or re-streamed for the changes to take effect.
  There&#x27;s a limit of 32 characters on each number plate (including embedded colors).
  The text length that can be seen on the number plate is around 9 to 10 characters, more characters will cause the text to split.
  Some vehicle models has a backward number plate, e.g. Boxville (498) (as an alternative to this vehicle you can use vehicle model ID 609, which is a duplicated Boxville (aka Boxburg), but with a regular number plate).
  This function only works in versions 0.2.1, 0.2.2, 0.2x and 0.3c (and beyond).
